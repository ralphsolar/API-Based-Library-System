# API Based Library Management System


**Author**: Ralph Jacob S. Solar

## Description üìñ
The **API Based Library Management System** is an api-based application that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage a collection of books in a library. Users can add new books to the system and view the list of books. The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and token-based authorization for access to certain endpoints.

## Software and Technologies  üíª
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language.
- **Slim Framework**: A micro framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and book information.
- **JSON**: For data exchange in API requests and responses.

## Main Highlights üåü
1. **Dependencies and Configuration**:
   - The project uses the Slim framework and Firebase JWT for authentication.
   - The `composer.json` file manages dependencies, and the `vendor/autoload.php` is included to load necessary classes.

2. **JWT Middleware**:
   - A middleware that ensures requests are authenticated using a valid JWT token.
   - The token is validated and the user's information is extracted for further request processing.
   - Invalid or reused tokens are rejected.

3. **Token Generation**:
   - The `generateToken()` function creates a JWT token with an expiration time of 1 hour.
   - The token includes the user ID and username in the payload for authorization.

## Endpoints üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. User Registration
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/user/register`
- **Description**: This endpoint allows a new user to register by providing a unique username and password. Upon successful registration, the user‚Äôs credentials are stored in the database, and they can later authenticate to access the system. If the username is already taken, the system will return a failure response with an appropriate message.
- **Sample Request (JSON Payload)**:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "ralphsolar24",
    "password": "ralph_dmmmsu24"
  }

- **Sample Response (JSON) if successful**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": null
  }
- **Sample Response (JSON) if failed and user already exist**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "fail",
    "data": {
        "message": "Username exists. Try Again"
  }
  }
---
### 2. User Authentication
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/user/authenticate`
- **Description**: This endpoint allows users to authenticate by providing their username and password. If the credentials are valid, the system generates and returns a JWT token, which the user can use for subsequent requests. The JWT token is required to interact with protected endpoints (such as adding books or borrowing books), ensuring that only authenticated users can access these actions.
- **Sample Request (JSON Payload)**:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "ralphsolar24",
    "password": "ralph_dmmmsu24"
  }

- **Sample Response (JSON) if successful**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "token": "your-jwt-token",
    "data": {
        "userid": 1,
        "username": "ralphsolar24"
  }
  }
---
### 3. Add Book
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/book/add`
- **Description**: This endpoint allows an authenticated user to add a new book to the library collection. To ensure security, the request must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header. The book details (e.g., title, genre, description, publisher) are provided in the request body, and upon success, the new book is saved in the database. A new JWT token is returned to ensure the session remains valid after this action.
- **Sample Request (JSON Payload)**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "genre": "Fiction",
    "description": "A novel about the American dream.",
    "pub_yr": 1925,
    "publisher": "Scribner",
    "language": "English",
    "num_page": 180
  }

- **Sample Response (JSON) if successful**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "new_token": "new-jwt-token",
    "data": null
  }

- **Sample Response (JSON) if failed**:
  ```json
  {
  "status": "fail",
  "data": "Invalid or reused token"
  }
---
### 4. List Book
- **Method**: `GET`

The response includes details about each book in the collection, such as title, genre, description, and more. This endpoint is essential for displaying the complete library collection to users.
- **Sample Request (No Payload)**:
  Send the request with the Authorization: Token <your-jwt-token> header.

- **Sample Response (JSON) if successful**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "new_token": "new-jwt-token",
    "data": [
